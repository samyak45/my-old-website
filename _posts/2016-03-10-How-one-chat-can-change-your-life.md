Have you watched the TED Talk by Jon Ronson on “How one tweet can ruin your life” ? If you haven’t, watch it sometime when you are not busy aimlessly scrolling down monotonous Facebook news feed. 

In a jaw-dropping story of how one un-funny tweet ruined a woman's life and career, Ronson shows how online commenters can end up behaving like a baying mob — and says it's time to rethink how we interact online. 

It got me thinking I can do a Ted Talk on “How one chat can change your life” (and I realized one needs to be invited to give a Ted Talk, and I don’t have an invite).

Anyway, till I get an invite to do a TED talk, here follows a lesser known yet similar incident when social shaming spiralled out of control.

Main charaters :

 - *chalenge_lene_wala* (a guy with ludicrous tendency to accept challenges and one struggling to gain social acceptance)

 -*chalenge_dene_wala* (a conceited old "friend" of *chalenge_lene_wala*)

 -*the_bandi* ("a" self-seeking girl in a iit, aspiring to become "the" girl in the iit)

 -*bandi_ka_banda* (*the_bandi*'s boyfriend)

 -*not_so_righteous_hypocrite* (a mutual acquaintance who proclaims righteousness but proves to be otherwise)

 -*the_saviour* (*chalenge_lene_wala*'s close friend)
