/* A blogpost where I discuss <what>. Yet again an acknowledgement goes to my brother Ishan who although didn't help me directly in writing this post this time but I owe him (and his constant  stream of "new" ideas) for pushing me into the mental frame for writing this post. */

<conversation with Ishan regarding artificial trees>

When you are close to completing your graduation and have spent more than 3 years paying more attention on 'HOW' to do things, giving little thought to 'WHAT' to do and negligible thought to 'WHY', it can be a blessing (and simultaneously mind turbulating) to have a (~ 4-7 years) younger brother/sister akin to your old self - one who constantly reminds you of 'WHAT' you wished to do years ago that you have possibly lost sight of while laborously working on the 'HOW' to do it.

I consider myself fortunate to have a younger brother so alike my former self (though more mischievious and troublesome - our generation were certainly better as kids or atleast I was a better kid! :D ). While his ideas on world betterment, "new" inventions, and "revolutionary" enterprises are palpably ludicrous and one's that can be dismissed with not so much of <what> of <what>, they act as a constant reminder of my old dreams and rejuventate the visionary in me.

As I am typing this I lean back on my chair, take a deep breath and look at my 'post-exam, packing my trunk and about to leave for home in few hours' room with glazed eyes. Probably it is the sunset yellow light pouring in from the wondow that reminds me of the 'harry potter, chamber of secrets, "but I can show you" diary scene' or it is just the conversation I had with my brother an hour ago (this time he was upbeat with "his new idea" on artificially intelligent personal home assistants, which I coldly disregarded, premising my dismissal on the idea being far from new, several tech colossus already working on the idea and the fundamental technological difficulties that make it currently impractical) that makes me reminiscent of an old conversation I had with my school teacher. 

<conversaion about what do you wish to do, I wish to create {something, something - like jarvis}. My teacher gives me the {adj}smile I now give to kids talking to me about {something} and asks how I plan to do that. I tell about my plans to study computer science from a good college, study artificial intelligence, do research, etc, etc>

I sly smile comes across my face as I remebered that lost, innocent childhood.

(Don't laught at me. <> can be cool things in the 'near' future. Moreover, I had watched Iron man movie (I) few days back and the geek in me was supposed to be <mesmerized> by Jarvis.)

Following is the conversation I had few weeks back with a classmate :<some gibberish on convolution neural nets, deep learning and shit -- doing that in summer. What will you do with that knowledge and why do you wish to learn the stuff -- it is in the hype, interviews, etc>

The years between junior high school and end of college are years of <massive> changes - we experience a change of personality, change in perception, change in life goals, a complete change in ourselves. While most of these changes are essential to make a transition into independent adults, we and our society could be better off without some others. 

The biggest, inadvertent, change we experience is a loss of dreams. As kids we dream of living and creating a fantasy (ulterian) world where <describe it>. As we grow older these dreams are replaced by those of 9 digit bank balances, private jets and humangous mansions. Eventually, mediocity and the feeling of "the world is too big and challenging for us to be someone or do something significant " dawns in and our dreams turn into mediocre aspirations of good enough jobs and comfortable enough lives (don't miss the enough stressing on the loss of ambition).

Education is imperaive. It teaches us how to convert our vision into a reality. It has taught me <some ai, ml complicated gibberish>. The only problem - on completing our formal education, few of us are left with any dreams to build (except <some mediocre dream examlpe>).

<those of us who follow the how miss site of the what and those who maintain site of the what often miss out elements of how - elaborate>

I can sence <adj> readers thinking "itni hi dikkt h to tu khud hi koi trika btade is samasya se bachne ka" (if you have so much problem why don't you yourself come up with some solution). Note the 'khud hi' (yourself). Like all problems I ponder about (and have either written or plan to write a blogpost about), this too requires a cultural shift. It is not a problem a single individual or a small group of invdividuals can solve. It requires a [change in our idiosyncrasies (behaviour or way of thinking), a change in what we converse about in our everyday conversations](<we all think>) and a change in what we value in life.

Yeah, yeah all that sounds like something worthwhile but dude, everyone need to earn a living. <give a powerful answer, quote financial independence and stuff from your money or your life>

The "WHAT", the "HOW" and the "WHY" are three cornerstones of <what - success, building something significant, living a more fulfilling life, etc>. The cornerstones are universal and applicable to individuals, organizations and communities alike. 

The 'WHAT' gives us the vision, the 'HOW' gives us the process or methodology, and the 'WHY' gives us the reason.

Without a vision individuals and enterprises would be directionless and as <the wise saying goes/ xyz told abc in Alice in Wonderland> "if you don't know where you are headed any road will take you there". Without a vision <what would happpen>.

If you don't know the how of how to realize your vision, <>. There cannot be a bigger disgrace to your dreams.

Not knowing "WHY" you wish to create 'WHAT' you wish to create (or are in the process of creating) will leave you driveless and unmotivated in no time. Everytime, someone will ridicule your vision you will be left questioning it yourself and give into the arguments of the <lip curlers> and give up on the vision. If you can't answer the WHY people will not take you seriously, investors(if required) won't fund your endeavour and friends & family will either not support you or support you half-heartedly. 'WHY' is the founding pillar and nothing great was ever built on <adj - shaky> foundations. So, [start with why]().

<pic of Milwaukee Art Museum>

Thinking of 'WHAT', 'HOW' and the 'WHY' reminds me of the life story of Santiago Calatrava - the architect, cum civil engineer, cum artist who disigned the Milwaukee Art Museum. <brief info on his life story and on the museum>.

Some webperson once told me good designers who can write their own desgin code are like goldflakes in the industry. I could immediately relate this to the combination of 'WHAT' with 'HOW'. Certainly it is more convenient and <productive> to have one person to knowing both what ot create and how to create than to have the what person (the designer) explain things to the how person(the developer). 

While it is always better to have a single individual knowing both the 'WHAT' and the 'HOW', such individuals are as rare as <what - Facebook/Mark Zuckerberg example?>. <following one - lose sight of other .. elaborate>. The alternative being teaming up. <apple example>. The team could be better if the 'WHYs' of the 'WHAT' and 'HOW' are more compatible. <Google example>. 

Whether you are a <what> or <what>, a <what> or <what>, the 3 cornerstones govern your life.

So start asking yourself 'WHAT', 'HOW' and the 'WHY' (if you don't already). / You *might* start considering to ask yourself 'WHAT', 'HOW' and the 'WHY' (if you aren't already).

Peace out.
