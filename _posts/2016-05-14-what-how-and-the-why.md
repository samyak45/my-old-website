/* A blogpost where I discuss <what>. Yet again an acknowledgement goes to my brother Ishan who although didn't help me directly in writing this post this time but I owe him (and his constant  stream of "new" ideas) for pushing me into the mental frame for writing this post. */

"I have an idea to build synthetic trees to reduce global warming and oxigenate our degrading environment.", says my brother [Ishan](https://www.facebook.com/ishan.dubey.585).

When you are close to completing your graduation and have spent more than 3 years paying more attention on 'HOW' to do things, giving little thought to 'WHAT' to do and negligible thought to 'WHY', it can be a blessing (and simultaneously mind turbulating) to have a (~ 4-7 years) younger brother/sister akin to your old self - one who constantly reminds you of 'WHAT' you wished to do years ago that you have possibly lost sight of while laborously working on the 'HOW' to do it.

I consider myself fortunate to have a younger brother so alike my former self (though more mischievious and troublesome - our generation were certainly better as kids or atleast I was a better kid! :D ). While his ideas on world betterment, "new" inventions, and "revolutionary" enterprises are palpably ludicrous and one's that can be dismissed with not so much of <what> of <what>, they act as a constant reminder of my old dreams and rejuventate the visionary in me.

As I am typing this I lean back on my chair, take a deep breath and look at my 'post-exam, packing my trunk and about to leave for home in few hours' room with glazed eyes. Probably it is the sunset yellow light pouring in from the wondow that reminds me of the 'harry potter, chamber of secrets, "but I can show you" diary scene' or it is just the conversation I had with my brother an hour ago (this time he was upbeat with "his new idea" on artificially intelligent personal home assistants, which I coldly disregarded, premising my dismissal on the idea being far from new, several tech colossus already working on the idea and the fundamental technological difficulties that make it currently impractical) that makes me reminiscent of an old conversation I had with my school teacher.

my (<adj>) teacher : You are quite bright a student, I am curious to know what do you aspire to do in life?

me : I want to build a very intelligent A.I. operating system. One that can adapt according to it's user and respond to the user's thougts. One that could be a friend, advisor, and personal assistant at the same time. One that can be integrated into our future smart home computing system, security system, our offices, cars and everywhere else we can be.

The teacher gives me that <?> smile, one that I now give to my brother, and asks : That sounds marvellous. How do you plan on making this vision a reality ?

me (<?>): I plan on getting admission in good engineering college. My dad tells me IITs are the best in India. There I will study computer science, artificial intelligence, and whatever else will be required and then use the acquired knowledge to make my A.I. agent.

my teacher (I now wonder how she was managed to control her laughter) : That sounds like a plan. Good luck!.

I sly smile comes across my face as I remebered that lost, innocent childhood.

Now, don't laught at me. I had watched Iron Man movie (I) few days back and the geek-cum-dreamer in me was supposed to be entranced by [JARVIS](http://ironman.wikia.com/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.). 

(Moreover smart AI assistants that can help us in everything from accomplishing our daily tasks and travels to eventually tackling even bigger challenges like climate change and cancer diagnosis are indisputably the future and we will soon be [moving from mobile first to an AI first world](http://www.businessinsider.in/Google-CEO-Were-headed-towards-an-AI-first-world/articleshow/51935048.cms).)

I recall having an obverse conversation with one of my classmates few days back. It was a long, involved discussion on convolutional neural nets, deep learning, and other machine learning stuff. 

The (lacklusture) reasons for us troubling our exam prep exhausted brains - 1. The upcoming machine learning (ML) viva and, 2. The topics are in hype in the trendy data science community and their knowledge necessary to crack any data analyst interview.

Don't fret, I won't trouble my long-suffering reader with the ML blather. :P

The years between junior high school and end of college are years of myriad of changes - we experience a change of personality, change in perception, change in life goals, a complete change in ourselves. While most of these changes are essential to make a transition into independent adults, we and our society could (presumably) be better off without some others. 

The biggest, inadvertent, change we experience is a loss of dreams.

As kids we dream of living and creating a fantasy, utopian world having wonders such as intelligent robots, flying cars, virtual reality games, space travel (maybe even time travel), teleportation, super human abilities (think x-men). A world free from diseases, global warming, pollution, and other environmental problems. A world free from greed, hunger, (personal/physical/political/social/cultural)boundaries, politics and religion - a place where everyone lives in peace and harmony. A united society where people work together towards making the world a better place and people are not caught up in fulfilling their cynical objectives.

As we grow older these dreams are replaced by those of 9 digit bank balances, private jets and humangous mansions. Eventually, mediocity and the feeling of "the world is too big and challenging for us to be someone or do something significant " dawns in and our dreams turn into mediocre aspirations of good enough jobs and comfortable enough lives (don't miss the 'enough' indicating lost enthusiasm and shrunken ambition).

Education is imperaive. It teaches us how to convert our vision into a reality. (It has taught me AI algorithms, data science, operating systems, etc). The only problem - on completing our formal education, few of us are left with any dreams to build. (I don't consider aspiration for a high-paying job, 6-digit bank balance, cozy retirement and exotic vacations as 'dreams').

Some among us (the "lost" dreamers ?) manage to not lose sight of the dreams they wished to build when young but alas, these are the same people who are uninfluenced by cruddy drivers such as grades, and job. Unable to relate the process ('HOW') to their vision ('WHAT'), they often fall behind in our regimented system and fail to acquire the requisite skillset. (Advice to such co-dreamers : trust the process).

Opposed to the visionaries, are the pragmatic people. Driven by short-term goals, fear and peer competition they become experts in their domain but alas the lack of vision leaves them vying for <> and eventually makes them settle into a lackadaisical life.

I can sence <adj> readers thinking "itni hi dikkt h to tu khud hi koi trika btade is samasya se bachne ka" (if you have so much problem why don't you yourself come up with some solution). Note the 'khud hi' (yourself). Like all problems I ponder about (and have either written or plan to write a blogpost about), this too requires a cultural shift. It is not a problem a single individual or a small group of invdividuals can solve. It requires a [change in our idiosyncrasies (behaviour or way of thinking), a change in what we converse about in our everyday conversations](<we all think>) and a change in what we value in life.

Yeah, yeah all that sounds like something worthwhile but dude, everyone need to earn a living. <give a powerful answer, quote financial independence and stuff from your money or your life>

The "WHAT", the "HOW" and the "WHY" are three cornerstones of <what - success, building something significant, living a more fulfilling life, etc>. The cornerstones are universal and applicable to individuals, organizations and communities alike. 

The 'WHAT' gives us the vision, the 'HOW' gives us the process or methodology, and the 'WHY' gives us the reason.

Without a vision individuals and enterprises would be directionless and as <the wise saying goes/ xyz told abc in Alice in Wonderland> "if you don't know where you are headed any road will take you there". Without a vision <what would happpen>.

If you don't know the how of how to realize your vision, <>. There cannot be a bigger disgrace to your dreams.

Not knowing "WHY" you wish to create 'WHAT' you wish to create (or are in the process of creating) will leave you driveless and unmotivated in no time. Everytime, someone will ridicule your vision you will be left questioning it yourself and give into the arguments of the <lip curlers> and give up on the vision. If you can't answer the WHY people will not take you seriously, investors(if required) won't fund your endeavour and friends & family will either not support you or support you half-heartedly. 'WHY' is the founding pillar and nothing great was ever built on <adj - shaky> foundations. So, [start with why]().

<pic of Milwaukee Art Museum>

Thinking of 'WHAT', 'HOW' and the 'WHY' reminds me of the life story of Santiago Calatrava - the architect, cum civil engineer, cum artist who disigned the Milwaukee Art Museum. <brief info on his life story and on the museum>.

Some webperson once told me good designers who can write their own desgin code are like goldflakes in the industry. I could immediately relate this to the combination of 'WHAT' with 'HOW'. Certainly it is more convenient and <productive> to have one person to knowing both what ot create and how to create than to have the what person (the designer) explain things to the how person(the developer). 

While it is always better to have a single individual knowing both the 'WHAT' and the 'HOW', such individuals are as rare as <what - Facebook/Mark Zuckerberg example?>. <following one - lose sight of other .. elaborate>. The alternative being teaming up. <apple example>. The team could be better if the 'WHYs' of the 'WHAT' and 'HOW' are more compatible. <Google example>. 

Whether you are a <what> or <what>, a <what> or <what>, the 3 cornerstones govern your life.

So start asking yourself 'WHAT', 'HOW' and the 'WHY' (if you don't already). / You *might* start considering to ask yourself 'WHAT', 'HOW' and the 'WHY' (if you aren't already).

Peace out.
