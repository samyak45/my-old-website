/* A blogpost where I discuss <what>. Yet again an acknowledgement goes to my brother Ishan who although didn't help me directly in writing this post this time but I owe him (and his constant  stream of "new" ideas) for pushing me into the mental frame for writing this post. */

"I have an idea to build synthetic trees to reduce global warming and oxigenate our degrading environment.", says my brother [Ishan](https://www.facebook.com/ishan.dubey.585).

When you are close to completing your graduation and have spent more than 3 years paying more attention on 'HOW' to do things, giving little thought to 'WHAT' to do and negligible thought to 'WHY', it can be a blessing (and simultaneously mind turbulating) to have a (~ 4-7 years) younger brother/sister akin to your old self - one who constantly reminds you of 'WHAT' you wished to do years ago that you have possibly lost sight of while laborously working on the 'HOW' to do it.

I consider myself fortunate to have a younger brother so alike my former self (though more mischievious and troublesome - our generation were certainly better as kids or atleast I was a better kid! :D ). While his ideas on world betterment, "new" inventions, and "revolutionary" enterprises are palpably ludicrous and one's that can be dismissed with not so much of <what> of <what>, they act as a constant reminder of my old dreams and rejuventate the visionary in me.

As I am typing this I lean back on my chair, take a deep breath and look at my 'post-exam, packing my trunk and about to leave for home in few hours' room with glazed eyes. Probably it is the sunset yellow light pouring in from the wondow that reminds me of the 'harry potter, chamber of secrets, "but I can show you" diary scene' or it is just the conversation I had with my brother an hour ago (this time he was upbeat with "his new idea" on artificially intelligent personal home assistants, which I coldly disregarded, premising my dismissal on the idea being far from new, several tech colossus already working on the idea and the fundamental technological difficulties that make it currently impractical) that makes me reminiscent of an old conversation I had with my school teacher.

my (<adj>) teacher : You are quite bright a student, I am curious to know what do you aspire to do in life?

me : I want to build a very intelligent A.I. operating system. One that can adapt according to it's user and respond to the user's thougts. One that could be a friend, advisor, and personal assistant at the same time. One that can be integrated into our future smart home computing system, security system, our offices, cars and everywhere else we can be.

The teacher gives me that <?> smile, one that I now give to my brother, and asks : That sounds marvellous. How do you plan on making this vision a reality ?

me (<?>): I plan on getting admission in good engineering college. My dad tells me IITs are the best in India. There I will study computer science, artificial intelligence, and whatever else will be required and then use the acquired knowledge to make my A.I. agent.

my teacher (I now wonder how she was managed to control her laughter) : That sounds like a plan. Good luck!.

I sly smile comes across my face as I remebered that lost, innocent childhood.

Now, don't laught at me. I had watched Iron Man movie (I) few days back and the geek-cum-dreamer in me was supposed to be entranced by [JARVIS](http://ironman.wikia.com/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.). 

(Moreover smart AI assistants that can help us in everything from accomplishing our daily tasks and travels to eventually tackling even bigger challenges like climate change and cancer diagnosis are indisputably the future and we will soon be [moving from mobile first to an AI first world](http://www.businessinsider.in/Google-CEO-Were-headed-towards-an-AI-first-world/articleshow/51935048.cms).)

I recall having an obverse conversation with one of my classmates few days back. It was a long, involved discussion on convolutional neural nets, deep learning, and other machine learning stuff. 

The (lacklusture) reasons for us troubling our exam prep exhausted brains - 1. The upcoming machine learning (ML) viva and, 2. The topics are in hype in the trendy data science community and their knowledge necessary to crack any data analyst interview.

Don't fret, I won't trouble my long-suffering reader with the ML blather. :P

The years between junior high school and end of college are years of myriad of changes - we experience a change of personality, change in perception, change in life goals, a complete change in ourselves. While most of these changes are essential to make a transition into independent adults, we and our society could (presumably) be better off without some others. 

The biggest, inadvertent, change we experience is a loss of dreams.

As kids we dream of living and creating a fantasy, utopian world having wonders such as intelligent robots, flying cars, virtual reality games, space travel (maybe even time travel), teleportation, super human abilities (think x-men). A world free from diseases, global warming, pollution, and other environmental problems. A world free from greed, hunger, (personal/physical/political/social/cultural)boundaries, politics and religion - a place where everyone lives in peace and harmony. A united society where people work together towards making the world a better place and people are not caught up in fulfilling their cynical objectives.

As we grow older these dreams are replaced by those of 9 digit bank balances, private jets and humangous mansions. Eventually, mediocity and the feeling of "the world is too big and challenging for us to be someone or do something significant " dawns in and our dreams turn into mediocre aspirations of good enough jobs and comfortable enough lives (don't miss the 'enough' indicating lost enthusiasm and shrunken ambition).

Education is imperaive. It teaches us how to convert our vision into a reality. (It has taught me AI algorithms, data science, operating systems, etc). The only problem - on completing our formal education, few of us are left with any dreams to build. (I don't consider aspiration for a high-paying job, 6-digit bank balance, cozy retirement and exotic vacations as 'dreams').

Some among us (the "lost" dreamers ?) manage to not lose sight of the dreams they wished to build when young but alas, these are the same people who are uninfluenced by cruddy drivers such as grades, and job. Unable to relate the process ('HOW') to their vision ('WHAT'), they often fall behind in our regimented system and fail to acquire the requisite skillset. (Advice to such co-dreamers : trust the process!)

Opposed to the visionaries, are the pragmatic people. Driven by short-term goals, fear and peer competition they become experts in their domain but alas the lack of vision leaves them vying for limited resources over conflicting goals. This eventually wears them out and makes them settle into a lackadaisical life in a dead-end career.

I can sense some scorching readers thinking "itni hi dikkt h to tu khud hi koi trika btade is samasya se bachne ka" {if you have so much problem why don't you yourself come up with some solution}. (Note the 'khud hi' {yourself}). (Unfortunately) Like all problems I ponder about (and have either written or plan to write an idiosyncratic blogpost about), this too requires a cultural shift. It is not a problem a single individual or a small group of invdividuals can solve. It requires a change in our belief system, a change in our attitudes, a change in our everyday conversations and a change in our what we value in life.

Yeah, yeah all that sounds like something worthwhile but dude, everyone need to earn a living. Yes, we need money to live a comfortable and promising life however, we need to [transform our relationship with money](https://ymoyl.wordpress.com/summary-of-your-money-or-your-life/). We need to get away from our consumerist culture. Rather than viewing money as an endproduct or a way to achieve respectable societal status and to acquire ostentatious material possessions, we need to view money for what it is - a tool to lead a happy, comfortable, and fulfilling life that can be put to use to build our dreams. 

(I will advice you to read the book ["Your Money or Your Life"](https://ymoyl.wordpress.com/summary-of-your-money-or-your-life/) and the concepts of 'Financial Intelligence', 'Financial Integrity', and 'Financial Independence' *might* change your perception of money.) 

The title of this post says "What, How and the Why" and I apologize for lingering at the frontier a little too long. To my forbearing reader, bear a little longer and you might find some meaning out of this rather juvenile post in the paragraphs to follow.

The "WHAT", the "HOW" and the "WHY" are three cornerstones of living a more fulfilling and meaningful life. They are universal and applicable to individuals, organizations and communities alike.

The 'WHAT' gives us the vision, the 'HOW' gives us the process or methodology, and the 'WHY' gives us the reason.

> WHAT <- Vision
> HOW <- Process
> WHY <- Reason

Your vision — or your “mission statement” — declares where you (or your organization) is headed and what it will look like when it's arrived. It tells you what success (for you) looks like. How else will you know when you’ve achieved it? 

> "If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will take you there."

A vision forces you to really know your ambitions and declares the outcomes you expect, becoming a guiding light to lead you forward. Without a vision individuals and enterprises would be directionless and will not have anything to fall back on when plans go south and objectives are not met.

Any map/strategic plan/process is useless if you don't know where you are going. Once you get (crystal) clear on WHAT you want, the HOW (almost) takes care of itself. 

The 'WHAT' always need to come before the 'HOW'. Being more concerned about the 'HOW' too early, inhibits your vision and blocks you from thinking as big as you need to think. What you need is a vision that is so big that it is compelling, not only to others, but to you. A compelling vision gives the motivation required to stay the course and also urges others to your assistance.

If vision is all that was required, <what would have happened>. Once you have figured out 'WHAT' you wish to do, you ought to figure out 'HOW' you plan on doing it. You must know the sequence of actions that need to be taken to achieve your goal and answering the 'HOW is figuring out that required sequence of actions. 

The 'HOW' provides you a roadmap, an itinerary to reach your destination. It is a tool to see how much you have progressed towards your goals and how far you are from your destination. Knowing where you are is essential for making good decisions on where to go or what to do next. Without a detailed roadmap you will be left wandering <where> and soon run out of resources.

Moreover, with careful planning you often can see if at some point you are likely to face a problem. It is much easier to adjust your plan to avoid or smoothen a coming crisis, rather than to deal with the crisis when it comes unexpected.

<need to improvise>

Not knowing "WHY" you wish to create 'WHAT' you wish to create (or are in the process of creating) will leave you driveless and unmotivated in no time. Everytime, someone will ridicule your vision you will be left questioning it yourself and give into the arguments of the <lip curlers> and give up on the vision. If you can't answer the WHY, people will not take you seriously, investors(if required) won't fund your endeavour and friends & family will either not support you or support you half-heartedly. 'WHY' is the foundation or soul of your endeaour and nothing great was ever built with a shaky foundation. So, [start with why](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7108725-start-with-why) (<- a good business book to learn from).

<interlinked and-or trees>

The CS-AI geek in me models the "What, How, Why" in the form of interlinked [AND-OR trees](<wiki link>). 

The nodes of the trees are goals or sub-goals. In order to achieve a goal you need to achieve a conjunction of sub-goals (children of the goal node connected by an arc) however, their might be alternative ways to achieve any goal i.e. a disjunction (of conjunctions) exists. 

Unlike traditional AND-OR trees in which each child has a single parent, in the search space (our life) a child can have multiple parents i.e after achieving certain sub-goals we can proceed forward to achieve multiple goals. 

Now here is the catch, in the end we cannot be at multiple root nodes. Of all the possible root nodes at which we can be, only one is the 'victory node' while the rest are 'traps' or deadends. But we traverse the tree bottom up so, how do we avoid false paths leading us to trap (deadend) nodes? We make use of 'WHY links'! 

When achieving the sub-goals becomes timeconsuming and overly demanding, we might lose our way (and other searchers of the search space will mostly confuse us since they might not be related by blood). The 'WHY links' are backlinks from children to parents, helping the child in distinguishing the 'true' parent from the impostors. They are like reminders - "Ok, I achieved this sub-goal but why did I want to achieve this in the first place? To achieve get to this parent goal and not these parent goals."

Thinking of 'WHAT', 'HOW' and the 'WHY' reminds me of the life story of Santiago Calatrava - the architect, cum civil engineer, cum artist who disigned the Milwaukee Art Museum. The museum consists of a long glass-and-steel reception hall with an eighty-foot ceiling, all shaded by an enormous movalble sunscreen at the roof. The screem has two ribbed panels that open and close like the wings of a giant seagull, putting the entire edifice into motion and giving the sense of a building that could take flight!

<pic of Milwaukee Art Museum>

At a very early age, Santiago Calatrava developed a love for drawing. A certain paradox in drawing began to obsess him - "how to capture the true essence of life - everything in a state of change and motion - on paper, in an image that was perfectly still?"

He took classes and learned techniques for creating the various illusions of something caught in the moment of movement, but it was never quite enough. As a part of this impossible quest he taught himself aspects of mathematics, such as descriptive geometry, that could help him understand how to represent his objects in two dimensions. His skill improved and his interest in the subject deepened. It seemed he was destined for a career as an artist, and so he enrolled in an art school in Valencia.

A few months int his studies, he had a seemingly minor experience that would change the course of his life : browsing for supplies in a stationery store, his eye was drawn to a beautifully designed booklet describing the work of the great architect Le Corbusier. Somehow this architect had managed to create competely distinctive shapes. He turned even something as simple as a stairway into a dynamic piece of sculpture. The buildings he designed simply seemed to defy gravity, creating a feeling of movement in their still forms. Studying this booklet, Calatrava now developled a new obsession - to learn the secret of how such buildings came about. As soon as he could, he transferred to an architecture school.

Graduating from the architecture school, Calatrava had gained a solid foundation in the subject and was more than capable of taking his place in some architecture firm and working his way up. But he realized that while knew more than enough about the form and asthetics of the great works of architecture he most admired -  the Pantheon in Rome, the buildings of Gaudi in Barcelona, the bridges designed by Robert Maillart in Switzerland - ,he knew nothing about how they sttod up, how the pieces fit together, how the buildings of Le Corbusier (his inspiration mentioned above) managed to create that impression of movement and dynamism.

It was like knowing how to draw a beautiful bird but not understanding how it could fly. As with drawing, he wanted to go beyond the surface, the design element, and touch upon the reality. He felt that the world was changin; something was in the air. With advances in technology and new materials, revolutionary possibilities had emerged for a new kind of architecture, but to truly exploit that he would have to learn engineering. So, he made the fateful decision to virtually start over and again enroll into university to gain a degree in civil engineering.

After years of rigorous labour in the engineering college, driven by his childhood obsession to express movement and change, Santiago emerged as a "master" in civil engineering and architecture; one who broke the golden rule of architectue - "the buildings have to be stable and stationary" with his design and constructions, including but not <what> the Milwaukee Art Museum.

Some webperson once told me good designers who can write their own desgin code are like goldflakes in the industry. I could immediately relate this to the combination of 'WHAT' with 'HOW'. Certainly it is more convenient and <productive> to have one person to knowing both what to create and how to create than to have the what person (the designer) explain things to the how person(the developer). 

While it is always better to have a single individual knowing both the 'WHAT' and the 'HOW', such individuals are as rare as <what - Facebook/Mark Zuckerberg example?>. <following one - lose sight of other .. elaborate>. The alternative being teaming up. <apple example>. The team could be better if the 'WHYs' of the 'WHAT' and 'HOW' are more compatible. <Google example>. 

Whether you are a <what> or <what>, a <what> or <what>, the 3 cornerstones govern your life.

So start asking yourself 'WHAT', 'HOW' and the 'WHY' (if you don't already). / You *might* start considering to ask yourself 'WHAT', 'HOW' and the 'WHY' (if you aren't already).

Peace out.
