<find some complicated less known word relevant with this article, use Google define [word] feature, paste screenshot>

Did you know that ^^ ? Well I didn’t, but all I needed to do was type “define <word>” on Google search and hit enter.

Google’s dictionary feature (“define [word]” feature) is really cool. Need to make sure using the right word <in a pinch>, wish to know the correct pronunciation, or looking for a pretentious synonym for your email/blogpost/mag-article/class-presentation … Google dictionary is the feature to resort to!

Alas, if words were all that were required to understand this complicated place we call ‘world’, humans would have longer strides in, ahh… , everything. (And news and media wouldn’t have been flooded with <some trending, stupid debate - freebasics?).

Am really looking forward to the day Google would add a “define [person_name]” feature” and announce it to the world. Once in awhile I try Googling people just in case Google added the feature but the news agencies of the world were busy discussing <some stupid political or _ stuff> and the tech geeks were busy debating “Google/Facebook public surveillance issue”. 

Try searching for some person using Google search. You will only have Google throwing at you links to online profiles belonging to either the person or some other person going by the same name. I don’t about you but there certainly is lot more to my life than my Facebook, Quora, LinkedIn, Instagram, Google Plus profile, or this blog for that matter of fact.

Not more than two autumns back, I was determined to define someone. I tried Googling, regularly stalked Facebook profile, enquired people … no use!

Both Google search and Facebook failed me. 

(No I didn’t consider trying Bing or duckduckgo or anything with less than <> users.)

Apparently, even Google’s tremendous processing power of over 100 petaflops, more than 15 exabytes of accumulated data, <world’s best data analytics capabilities> and constant tracking & surveillance are not sufficient when it comes to defining humans. (And if Google can’t do it, I don’t expect any other <tech companies> to shouldn’t even think about it - ya I am a Google fanboy.)

In case you have not been able to move ahead of the question “Who is this person I was so keen on figuring out” - well he goes by the name ‘Samyak Choudhary’. No clicks? Hint : You are reading his blog right now.
I remember having the following conversation with my dad just few days before arriving at IITR. (I am not actually certain whether it ‘actually’ happened or was it just in my mind. Given the amount of time ‘hypothetical’ conversations run in my head, it’s difficult to distinguish between the two.) :

Me (filled with the ‘just cleared JEE enthusiasm’, with sparkling cheerful eyes) : Dad, college begins in a week now and I have no idea of what I will be like. How will I present myself ? What kind of people will I meet, will they be like me or will they be like most of my school mates? What can I do make people like me and to make new friends ? I don’t want IIT life to be like JEE, I wish to have fun but I also plan higher studies and have to be good in academics … 

Dad : Wow, slow down! Just be yourself, don’t shy away from talking with people and everything will be great.

Me : Be myself, but I don’t know who I am or what I will like to do or … 

Dad (with a puzzled look) : why, I thought you were certain you wanted to do research in Physics, do a Phd from .. and seem to be too obsessed with trying to become popular now, I don’t remember you being concerned about it earlier in school. Why this sudden change ?

Me : I don’t know, looking for a change I guess. (gives a fake laughter)

Me (think to myself) : perhaps because till now I had been the intersection of what you wanted me to be and what I could be … but not what I wanted to be. And the physics thing, that was class 10th!

<-- Now adopt a serious tone --> 

Defining our own personal identity can take a lifetime and to complicate matters, our identity changes throughout that period whether or not we consciously undertake a process of personal development.

The biggest hurdle in defining ourselves comes when there is a conflict of definition between how society defines us and how we define ourselves.

There are times when those around us label us as someone we are not, when the mirror image of what society is suggesting doesn’t reflect who we really are. Worse are those moments when the untrue image coming back to us feels so real that we begin to tell ourselves this is how things are supposed to be.

The world (and my life) seems to be overly saturated with people hardwired to jump to conclusions without grasping the complete picture - people who try to pigeonhole others based on circumstantial evidence. Friends, relatives, peers, people with no first degree connection, no group is free from such smart judgemental people.

(Btw, jumping to conclusions is a recognized cognitive distortion!)

Every guy (or girl) who loves maths or physics in school is not into research, every computer science major is not a nerd, and every playful conversationalist is not a flirt. But then it is a stereotypical world out there.

Have you watched the Ted Talk by Jon Ronson on “How one tweet can ruin your life” ? If you haven’t, watch it sometime when you are not busy scrolling down <adj> Facebook news feed. It is about how social media shaming over a misinterpreted tweet can ruin. It got me thinking I can do a Ted Talk on “How one chat can change your life” (and I realized one needs to be invited to give a Ted Talk, and I don’t have an invite).

I won’t trouble my busy reader with the details of the <dramatic story> of how my susceptibility to accept challenges and <a what type of girl> led to <what>. (middle finger to the sneering readers who know the story). The climax comprised of me standing on my best friend’s fifth floor balcony railing and contemplating a _ft dive into solid concrete below. Fortunately (unfortunately ?), I changed my mind. I love being famous but not with a with a distorted face, cracked skull picture of me being published in media!. (and to be a little more honest, I was wearing really tight jeans. I don’t know if people get to change clothes in afterlife but I was not taking any chances xD ).

No regrets though because what followed was pure epiphany. 

In moments of dissonance between who we think we are and what society says we are, the truth that wins is the one WE CHOOSE to believe. We are bestowed with choice, to choose the truth that determines our future - who we are, who we can be, what values we can have, what we can achieve.

We all can dream a far bigger dream than anybody can indicate for us. Unfortunately, we often let fear of social stigma curb our aspirations and are subdued by tyranny of low (realistic?) ambition.

Battling the majority opinion is difficult, and majority of us end up getting conquered. We tend to forget our version of us. Most of the times the hints are too subtle and <> to <>.

//Yet, we so often forget who we really are. The 



In a world <with what>, the question “Who am I” is so underrated. Yet this is the pivotal question on which the course of our entire life matters. 

Of course, personal identification goes beyond name, age, family background, job or educational qualifications. It is much deeper than that. It is about what values we live by, what do we strive to achieve, what do we wish to be recognized for, what do we intend to be remembered as, what do we desire to be as an individual.

Personal identification matters. The mind operates differently depending on how self is recognized. <elaborate> 

“Lie to anyone but yourself” - Anonymous

Self definition is the one area where dishonesty comes at a great personal cost. Dishonesty, when defining oneself can lead to missed opportunities and can become the barrier to an honest feedback.

People tend to flinch from confrontation. (“Hey, you say you aspire to be a <>, but you aren’t good at”, “Hey, you say <> is your key strength but the other time when <> you were nothing but pathetic at <>, “Hey,...”). However, I believe the fear of others dismissing our ideas or beliefs is ill founded. Open confrontation is the best way to gain feedback. Fear <of confrontation> implies <lack of faith in oneself and one’s beliefs> and foretells stagnation.

If you aspire to do something but don’t have the right skillset then you will have a difficult going, but that doesn’t make your aspirations <foolish>, all it means is there are areas you need to work on. If you believe you are good at something but others feel otherwise then maybe you need to be better at it. Someone just pointed out your key “weakness” ? Thank that person for you now know an “area of development” which will help you improve at both personal and professional level.
