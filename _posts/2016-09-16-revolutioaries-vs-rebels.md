<collage of some revolutionaries>

“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” - George Bernard Shaw 

Every day, we all encounter things we love and things that need to change. The former give us joy. The latter fuel our desire to make the world different—ideally better than the way we found it. But trying to change deep-seated beliefs and behaviors is daunting. Most accept the status quo because effecting real change seems impossible, some fight against it and very few manage to dismantle deep setted beliefs and redefine what the world believes in.

Recently I got caught up in an argument with one of my friends who accussed me of having undergone neuroplasticity and lost the courage to go against the grain. With insolence she said - "I was appreciative of the revolutionary I used to see in you, but alas you seem to have locked your rebellious streak inside some trunk and submerged the trunk in the shallow cruddy sea of social acceptance. Congrats, you are almost there to becoming another adult accepting defaults."

She is a teenager and I can't disapprove her of her infatuation with insurgence. A rampant rebelious streak is innate to people her age. 

In adolosence, while leaving the cocoon of childhood, we all are consumed by sky-high fantasies and find society around us as restraining. Unable to see the world as the shades of grey it is, we see it as a black and white and despite limited experiences, begin to question the social machinery established over <> years. Without taking the time to better understand the world and the people around us, we start envisioning to scrub off the greesy stains from this world and make it the "heavenly place" it should have already been when we were born!

"Inorder to win wars we can't afford losing, we need to stop waging battles one can be indifferent to.", I said.

Refuting her acute accusations through combination of logic and emotions superficially, I began to question my integrity internally. While I explained how inorder to win wars we can't afford losing, we need to stop waging battles one can be indifferent to, I began to wonder if I had already lost the the war whose battle flags I was blazing.

Soon, my mulling turned from questioning myself to sifting the definitions of rebels and revolutionaries. 

"What does it mean to be a revolutionary or a rebel?"

"What are the two like behind their public demeanor?"

"Are all revolutionaries rebels? If not, what is the difference between them?"

I arrived at the following findings after dicussing with friends over overstretched lunchtime conversations, reading biographies of people who have dismantled and <> the world and spending hours contemplating over raw facts and trying to connect them.


Rebels and revolutionaries are two different (<non-disjoint>) breeds of insurgents. While both loathe <adj> pre-established norms, the divergence lies in the approach they take to debunk them. The difference is subtle but clear.

(It might be helpful to visualize Bhagat Singh, Che Guevera and <>  as rebels and people like Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Madela as revolutionaries for the remaining of this article.)


#Who are rebels?

Do I really need to tell you who these conceited, egotistical, mutinous troublemakers with no regard for rules, regulations or authority are ? Considering the rising unrest in this world, I can only assume that the population of rebels is on a rise. Or probably it's just that like attracts like and without my knowledge I have recently been pushed into the 'Rebel Worldcup'!

Anyway, a rebel is a person who resists authority, control, or tradition.  Rebels fight against the status quo to resist authority or conformity and to promote or preserve their personal autonomy. Drawn towards seeking aesthetic perfection, their orientation is highly individualistic. 

Think Jack Sparrow (Pirates of the Caribbean), Arya Stark (Game of Thrones), and Dr. Gregory House (House, M.D.). If you have studied in IIT Roorkee between 2013-17 then a supercilious person with initials SV (I hope he doesn't kill me for this). If you have ever met me, then me. 

Though, the last person mentioned is the most charming maverick you might ever encounter. ;)

Noteworthiness, rarity, distinctiveness, individuality and/or the unusual, idiosyncratic or eccentric are what these characters value most highly in themselves and others.

These are idealists who have high standards and seek excellence in whatever they do. They believe that what is perfect but unavailable or unattainable is infinitely more desirable than what is flawed but possible or achievable. 

When you look at their lives, you always find them reaching for the unreachable star.

A typical idealist rebel's dialogue -

> “And maybe there’s no peace in this world, for us or for anyone else, I don’t know. But I do know that, as long as we live, we must remain true to ourselves.”  - Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) in Spartacus

You must consider yourself lucky if you have ever encountered a true revolutionary. And I take my hat off to you if you sucessfully endured the inborn sense of morality and virtuous nature that makes everyone else's distress over personal life issues seem pitiful. One problem though, I don't wear a hat :P .

A revolutionary is someone who works for political or social change.  The orientation is toward changing and improving society. Motivated towards seeking moral and ethical perfection, revolutionaries believe they could do better, others could improve and the world could be a better place.

Think Katniss (The Hunger Games), Dumbledore (Harry Poter), Batman (The Dark Knight) and Aragorn 2 (The Lord of the Rings).

Revolutionaries feel responsible for the greater good and for doing good. They wrestle with how far they should go in seeking justice and fairness for others, in exposing corruption and injustice or in standing up against evil or wrong-doing. They worry about with what is the higher duty and what exactly is required of them in response.

Note that these aren't idle dreamers, but people capable of taking concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting positive impact. They are decisive and strong-willed, and share a very unique combination of traits: though soft-spoken, they have very strong opinions and will fight tirelessly for an idea they believe in.

They are people of conscience who cause revolution to conform society, as a whole, to a higher moral or ethical standard.

As we trace the lives of several revolutionaries, we locate a common thread of virtue connecting their life events. Over the course of their lives these individuals are drawn further and further down the path of righteousness. They are compelled to do one small thing, then another and another until, in the end, they have sacrificed their personal concerns, their safety, their security, their family, their fortunes or often their lives.

Typical revolutionary monotone -

> “Wherever there’s a fight, so hungry people can eat, I’ll be there. Wherever there’s a cop beating up a guy, I’ll be there. I’ll be in the way guys yell when they are mad. I’ll be in the way kids laugh when they are hungry and they know supper’s ready, and when the people are eating the stuff they raise and living in the houses they build– I’ll be there, too.” - Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) in The Grapes of Wrath


#Behind the public demeanor

People's proclivity of remembering revolutionaries by their public facade of <> is <long known>. But here let's try to see what revolutionaries actually are behind their demeanor.

![Martin Luther King, Jr.](http://samyakchoudhary.com/img/martin-luther-king-dream-speech.jpg){: .center-image }

To substantially overturn an old system, one needs to be completely at odds with it. This belief is embedded so deeply in our cultural psyche that we rarely even stop to think about it. We see world changers as people who are impervious to opposition and simply don’t worry about the costs of non-conformity the way the rest of us do. Diplomacy and compromise don't seem to be the personality traits of individuals who drive change in the world. Right?

I will backpedal on this myth that has been cajoled into us by mythified stories of revolution and world change.

We see revolutionaries as freethinking idealists who, untethered by social proof, incessantly rebut theories, ideas and practices they don't believe in. They are seen as paragons of obstinate confidence. The image of a mutineer erupts in our heads when we come across the word "revolutionary" . This image is nothing but a mirage. 

Digging into the lives of Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and the like, reveals something inconceivably astounding. You realize as they question traditions and challenge the status quo, they may appear bold and self-assured on the surface. But when you peel back the layers, the truth is that they, too, grapple with fear, ambivalence, and self-doubt. We view them as self-starters, but their efforts are often fueled and sometimes forced by others. And as much as they seem to embrace conflict, they really prefer to avoid it.

Martin Luther King, Jr., the kingpin of the civil rights movement and who had a seismic impact on race relations in the United States, was apprehensive about joining the civil rights movement. He was nominated for presidency of Montgomery Improvement Association - the organization that catapulted the Montgomery Bus Boycott and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to the forefront of the national struggle for civil rights - by another member. King later reflected, “It had happened so quickly that I did not even have time to think it through. It is probable that if I had, I would have declined the nomination”.

<Mahatma gandhi example>

Nelson Mandela, the South African activist who played a key role in bringing an end to apartheid and was the leader of the antiapartheid movement, was born into a high-ranking royal family and was raised to be a tribal leader. Oblivious of the discrimination faced by urban blacks, he would have dutifully followed the life path pre-decided for him had he not fled to Jhoanesberg inorder to avoid an arranged marriage. As entering Jhonaeberg as an anonymous black person, he came to face-to-face with the brutual reality of racially divided South Africa. He had almost decided to go back to his village but was coaxed into attending a meeting of the African National Congress, an orgnization that aimed to establish a democratic government. Here Mandela presented the dichotomy between his life prior to coming to Jhoanesberg and his experiences there. Later, several militant young members of ANC met him and persuaded him to form and lead the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) to enforce a more radical approach against racial discrimination.

<rebels behind their public demeanor>

Anyway, enough of history. Let's talk movies!



#The Differentiation / The approach 

The core difference between a rebel and a revolutionary lies in the fact that while a rebel stands against something (e.g. colonisation, apartheid, poverty, etc), a revolutionary stands for something (e.g. people's rights, equality, better livelihood). However, as any <adj> movement progresses forward, these distinctions in <viewpoint/outlook> blur in since, advocating for new systems often requires demolishing the old way of doing things and engaging in acts of creative destruction. 

When the demarcation between these two breeds of insurgents eventually becomes almost non-existent, how do we distinguish between them and most importantly why does it even matter?

Revoluionaries vs Rebels (Part-2)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In Part-1 I talked about the definitions of rebels and revolutionaries and tried to understand how do they look like behind their public demeanor. If you haven't read that past, I recommend reading it first. 

In this post I will attempt to decipher the difference in approach towards change taken up by both revolutionaries and rebels and how their respective personalities shape the movement they are a part of. I will dig into the lives of some revolutioary rebels to look at how does it look like when a revolution becomes a rebellion or when a rebellion is used to bring a revolution. Finally I will conclude and try to build a consensus on how and why we need both of these forces to drive the world forward.

Irrespective of whether or not we are a part of a <national/international> movement, rebellion and revolution are two agents of change that never abandon us. They shape us and our world. From having shaped the history of our world (which in turn is responsible for our present) to  deciding the future course of the organizations we work for and the industries we work in, from determining how our past idiosyncrasies have shaped our current reputations to how our superiors and our colleagues are gonna respond to them now, from determining whether we will be just dismissed as another crazy person with a crazy idea or remembered as an individual who transfigured a domain.

Whether you are someone aspiring to bring a change or someone following others trying to or just a silent spectator, understanding the rebell mindset and the revolutionary mindset can help in making better decisions and getting better outcomes.

#Target of Attack

As mentioned towards the end of Part-1, the core difference between a rebel and a revolutionary lies in the fact that while a rebel stands against something (e.g. colonisation, apartheid, poverty, etc), a revolutionary stands for something (e.g. people's rights, equality, better livelihood). 

However, as any <adj> movement progresses forward, these distinctions in <viewpoint/outlook> blur in since, advocating for new systems often requires demolishing the old way of doing things and engaging in acts of creative destruction. 

#Different Approaches

The demarcation between rebels and revolutionaries lies in how they approach the different element of change and their motivations.

#Earning Status vs Disregarding Status Quo

When was the last time you entered a new society/ a new class/ a new organization and started suggesting in your initial days on how things can be done differently? What was the reaction of those around you? And if you managed to not give up on your idea and persevered there long enough, how were your suggestions then received?

Unless you were not known to be a rockstar of the field prior to entering or unless you managed to find an institution that truly appreciates speaking up with suggestions, it's likely that in the former case, even if your insights were indeed revolutionizing, you were squashed and got replies like "You just don't get it.", "This is not how things are done here.". In the latter case people would have lend you an ear, applauded you and even implemented your suggestions (even if they weren't truly worth implementing).

What leads to this difference in reception? Was it that the initial suggestions were not founded on solid ground and the later ones were more in sync with reality? Possibly but not necessarily. Even the exact same idea communicated in the two scenrios will be received as mentioned.

The difference lies in the words 'credibility', 'respect' and 'status'.

Power and status are not the same. Power is related with having influence (on others), status is about having the right to exercise power. Trying to exercise power without status is like trying to demolish a 100ft castle with 5ft thick boundary walls and a 20ft high metal gate using just your physical strength. With status, it's like "Well I don't exactly need to demolish this castle since I own it anyway".

Revolutionaries understand the value of status and know how to use it to achieve their objectives. Their operations are targeted towards rising up, gaining entry into the castle and then eventually conquering it from within. On the other hand, rebels completely disregard the status quo and attack the system from below.

No colonial government would tolerate a skinny <> year old man wearing lion cloth who is trying to create a ruckass by violating every other law they come up with. Unless that person earned the status, admiration and people's respect to make them fear simply shoving him off. And every other militant trying to surge terror would, at best, be subjected to trial and prosecuted.

The revolutionaries earn respect and admiration not only of the people they are fighting for but also of the establishment they are fighting against. This to an extent that the opposition begins to take their counsel to save itself!

“The way to come to power is not always to merely challenge the Establishment, but first make a place in it and then challenge and double-cross the Establishment.” - Francis Ford Coppola


#Incremental Change vs Complete Overhaul

(To the reader) Let me claim - "Your parents raised you wrong. Your school and college taught you wrong and your life till now has been anything but a lie. You will have to start all over again." An inane assertion, right?

Now what if I subtly say, "You are alright but you can do <something> better by making these adaptations." You might heed this suggestion.

A rebel will adopt the former approach; a revoluionary, the latter.

With their aspirations based on a utopian ideology, rebels often fail to foresee the repercusions of their stringent methods on themselves, the people around them and the institutions they are a part of. Very often in their "genuine struggle" for change, they jeopardize everyone's lives, freedom, or livelihoods. Historically, all mass rebellions have been marked with massive bloodshed.

Certain times do necessitate inharmonious measures and they might be the only <thing/force> saving the <victims> from oblivion. At other times, a more diplomatic approach can be used.

Revolutioaries bring radical transformations however, the transformation is incremental. Every revolution for national independence started as a moment seeking to extricate people from unjust laws. They start with aggreements were reached for both sides to find middle-ground and gradually proceed towards annihilating their nemesis, at every step using some trojan horse to mask their true objectives.


#Power of Idealism vs Power of Conscience

We all ocasionally come across person who are guided more by ideals than by practical considerations. People who often fail to see the flaw in themselves and in their fellow human beings. Rebels form the purest brand of idealists. 

Rebels are dreamers who tend to believe that once there rebellion has successfully accomplished it's objective, everything will be great and everyone will be happy. They can't be more out of sync with reality.

<how this affects the course of their actions>

Oftentimes, freedom can be more perishing than suppression. The unwarranted repercussions of mass rebellions can be far-reaching and can result in <>.

Have you ever come across the rare lot of people who have an inborn sense of idealism and morality, who tend to see helping others as their purpose in life and are often seen engaging in rescue efforts and doing charity work but whose real passion is to get to the heart of the issue so that people need not be rescued at all. People who advocate egalitarianism and they tend to believe that nothing would help the world so much as using love and compassion to soften the hearts of tyrants. But who aren't ideal dreamers and take concrete steps to realize their humanitarian vision.

That's the potrait of a revolutionary. 

Revolutionaries are people of conscience who believe in karma and pioneer the belief that means are as important as the end. 

<how this manifests into their actions>




#Struggle of the masses vs Elitist Struggle

The <> nature of rebellion restricts it to few (really?).

<conclusion>

From the top of my head, my closing thoughts are - 

I have been wasting my time and my readers time trying to make an unnecessary comparision. 

IMO, both are nuthead extremists but hey, only <nutheads> like these have been known to bring marked transormations!

I am just a <laid back/lazy> incorrigible rebel.

Now the conclusion that is expected from a 'serious' blogpost as this - 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rebels blame their enemy for all that's wrong and believe defeating the enemy will make everyting perfect. Revolutionaries are more pragmatic. They double-cross...

A rebel, contemptous of <> desires to knock down <>. A revolutionary plans to erect <a better wall> and does what it takes (knocking down or <>) to accomplish his plans. 

<complete overhaul vs incremental progress> 

<rebels take a 0 1 approach, see world as white and black -- this is good because it provides a radical approach as apposed to one provided by diplomatic revolutionaries but maybe infeasible - even if rebels win, the vistory might not lead to the perfect things they dreamt of e.g. Che Guevera -- but then does this mean revolutionaries lead to perfect outcomes? certainly the indo-pak splitup says otherwise. Well all such complete reestablishment is going to create powerful destructive waves but in the long run revolution serves to be better than rebellions.Rebels rush in. 

A rebel hates the establishment so much that he/she will prefer no establishment at all the one currently in place. A revolutionary loves his <dreamt establishment> that he can't be satisfied with anything less <>.


A perfect example of how <the gap fills in> is of Che Guevera. 

Another example comes from India's struggle for freedom. Mahatma Gandhi and 

But, despite how the <differences are covered up>. The fundamental difference in <vision> remains and continues to affect the way in which <...>. Revolutionaries listen, reflect and then speak/act. Rebels <do what>.

<fundamental approach idiosncracy credits, exercising power, becoming part of status quo.>

<conluding remarks -- need for rebels, creating waves, this article might be a little biased, bias spurs from my infatuation with planning and sophistication as apposed to blunt action>


http://www.etbscreenwriting.com/fine-distinctions/

 <negotiate>
... diff article on idiosncracy credits, exercising power, becoming part of status quo ....

In an organization, a rebel tries to exercise influence from below <...>. <..>

The <last> difference reminds me of <investopedia>. 

<Mahatma Gandhi>



Ironically while we use the term revolutionaries for both scientific and social stuff, in scientific revolutions we <understad> that coming up with new theories requires understanding pre-existing ones, in social we take it for granted that <... no pact, fight>.

I will close by suggesting a way to identify a revolutioary, rebel and confirmist in a <>. Ask <...>.

The confirmist would,

The rebel would,

The revolutionary would, 



While revolutionaries see the world differently and don't accept the status quo, they aren't necessarily your <something analogous>. Revolutionaries are people who take radical risks and are as <what> of going against the tide as the so called "confirmist majority". What makes them different is <what>.

Rebels on the other hand are people who <do what>. True rebels due to <what> might be almost as unlikely as those who accept the <status quo> to 'change the world'. Rebels apparently are people who could have revolutionized industries and changed midsets only if they had taken some time to understand their fellow beings and had learnt to keep quiet when they were better off not speaking.

I also realized that confirmists in no single category either. There are different types of confirmists. We have followers and we have acceptors.

Followers are true confirmists who <do what>.

On the other hand acceptors are people who <do what>. 

But very few are true followers or true acceptors, most lie somewhere in between. Even rebels lie on this confirmity scale if it is extrapolated <till what>. xD

So, how do you thing recognize a follower, an acceptor, a rebel and a revolutionary ? Well, all you need to do is <arrange for conversation> and converse on a slightly controverial topic. 

The follower will <do what>.

The acceptor would <do what>.

The rebel - wait, do I even need to be reminded of how to recognize a <adj adj rebel during a conversation>? Well I just did!

The revolutionary - I am still to come across a revolutionary but I would expect him/her to be a good listener who listens to arguments, reflects, comes up with an unbiased analysis and based on his understanding of the people around expresses his/her thouhgt in manner that <would what>.

I would close with one of my favourite quotes :

"<quote>".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here I am no way calling myself a revolutioary not because <> but because <>.
