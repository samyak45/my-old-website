  +We all think but do we all think in the same space?
  +Can thinking be quantified in terms of how deep we think, how far we think and how wide we think ? 
  +Is there a statistical measure to test the quality of our thoughts ?

> “Five percent of the people think; ten percent of the people think they think; and the other eighty-five percent would rather die than think.” ― Thomas A. Edison

I push myself back, sitting in the cozy cane chair in CCD and gaze in the eyes of my fellow deep thinking mate. Unraveling the <mysteries> of the conversation we were having, my mind unhooks from reality and loses itself in labyrinth of thoughts. 

I could see liquid chocolate coming out of my <choco lava cake>. "See" - That would be an understatement. I could absorb every detail of it. I could "feel" things happening around me with more than just my five senses.

I pondered over simple things. Things so absurdly simple, people don't pay attention to them. Yet when you give them thought, they are much complicated that the most complex equations.

Do people think? Do they think as I think? Do they realize the power of thought? My thoughts questioned the concept of reality. The very existence of beings.

The melting chocolate from the icing of my <choco lava cake> continues to sizzle down .... time seems to have frozen.

Gone are the days when not a single minute passed when me and my friend were not together however, one thing has remained invariant to the bleaching effect of time (yet)- our "sadist self-introspection". 

(I know self introspection doesn't make sense but we like to call it that.) 

Ocassionally the two of us manage to make time out of our busy scehdules to touch base over a meal and discuss what we consider "deep stuff" concering life, universe and us.

An average human brain thinks 70,000 thoughts in day, that makes about 3000 thoughts an hour and 50 thoughts per minute. The irony - I can't help asking myself all the time "Why can't people think?"! 

The whimsical nature of majority of human race has always confounded me. As a kid I loathed and envied kids around me who could just go with the flow, do what their friends do and unquestionably accept what the society taught them. //elaborate

A quadruple of people come and occupy a nearby table. 

  One of the guys (the despo girlfriend seeker) mocks one of the other three guys - "Kya baat h, aaj usse fursat mil gyi" (Wow you managed to find time away from her). 

  The no-longer-single guy gives a conceited smile (well when the college gender ratio stands at m:f if you are one of those fortunate (unfortunate) guys to have a girlfriend you are expected to feel special) and says in an artifcially sad tone "han yaar aaj uske parents aye hn" (her parents are here today). 

(I say in an artificial sad tone because I know what his true feelings currently are - relief. He is relieved to have got a short repite when he can be himself and not a ["dancing monkey"](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/696469-nick-and-i-we-sometimes-laugh-laugh-out-loud-at) (sorry girls, no offence intended).) 

  Yet another friend - the <> - comments "toh apne sas sasur se milne nhi jaega...". (then go and meet your in-laws)

I can feel the no-longer-single guy give a sigh that gives away the innumerable times he has been asked about his long term relationship plans which he is procrastinating to make till the day either he or his girlfriend decides to break-up. 

His sigh is lost in the envious assertion of the fourth friend - 
  
  "Teri toh majje hi majje hn, bandi h, acchi company mein internship h... ppo bhi lg hi jaega." (life's great for you - you have a girlfriend, have got good internship and most probably will get a pre-placemet offer from at your intern)

I take my attention away from their conversation because I know what all follows. 

It's the one of the popular "meaningless" conversation that tempts me to make an artificial intelligence bot - "Make IITian speak" (inpiration credits : [DeepDrumpf](https://www.gconew.com/tech/211678/atdeepdrumpf-is-an-ai-powered-twitterbot-that-tweets-like-donald-trump.html) ). 

Internship, placement, relationships (and break-ups), TV Shows, chapos, assigments - that were given a month earlier and somehow need to be completed in one evening and submitted before the midnight deadline - apparently exhausts the list of topics the myriad of conversations in IITR seem to revolve around. Ocassionally, fests, upcoming (and much needed) vacations, and upcoming (and dreaded) exams bring about the slight variety in our conversations without which <what would happen>.

No, I am no way implying that IITians (or any clan of people) can be clubbed together into a single species. The human race is too diverse for that. All I wish to say is <what>.

"I wonder if we are the only few people who introspect so much and reflect as critically as we do.", I think out loud.

"Maybe everyone thinks about these things once in a while but we can't say about others because these are not the type of conversations to have with just anyone. We can talk about such things with each other since, we know each other well. Who knows, contrary to our belief, we might be the two shallowest people around!", claims my logical friend.

Probably he is right. Probably amidst the cloud of "meaningless" conversations there exists <what>. Maybe everyone thinks the things I think but they are either too introverted to express their thoughts or the fear of being labeled a paranoid or <what> holds them back. Maybe it's the lack of trust in others or maybe it's the impression that others cannot understand their "deep" thoughts.

Probably it is not as much a question of capacity to think as much as it is a question of <a href=""> choosing what to think.</a> I came across an article on dimensionality of thought few months back (it still lies in my read later list), perhaps that's what the article was about.

I have known a parent who quit his job during the year his son had taken a drop to prepare for JEE and had gone to study in another city (where else but Kota - the hub for JEE preperation). The parent used to spend entire days sitting in the verandha thinking "What would happen if his son didn't qualify JEE", "Is he studying well.", "In which college to get him admitted to if the 'unfathomable' event of his son not qualifying JEE occurred.", etc. Now I am not an expert on how thoughts become things <link to why secret is bs> but I don't believe the parent's <adj> thoughts could have helped his son in cracking JEE.

The human brain seems to be like a replicating machine that continues to produce the same thoughts till either <what happens> or <what hapens>. Even then we continue to cling on to the same genre of notions and ideas. 

Rather than a count of number of thoughts crossing our mind the volumetric measures of how deep we think, how far we think and how wide we think, combined with the statistical measure of variance will give a better comparision for the quality of our thoughts. 

The ubiquitous pop of Facebook messenger brings me back to earth. One of my classmates messaged me "ml ka tut kiya?" (have you solved the machine learning tutorial?). 

"Abe aaj last date h ml ka assignment submit krne ki" (today is the last date to submit the Machine Learning assignment) I assert to my friend sitting across the table. I quickly finish my <choco latte> and we head back to the hostel. 

On the way my friend asks "By the way, have you watched this TV Show ..."

An average human brain thinks 70,000 thoughts in day, that makes about 3000 thoughts an hour and 50 thoughts per minute. Now assuming an average IITian brain to be having atleast <x%> higher capability at thinking and folowing the <abc> theory, that makes it <x> thoughs crossing the IITian brain every minute. The irony - I can't help asking myself all the time "Why can't people think?"! 
*/

/*
Probably, the variance of our thoughts would be a better statistical measure but then I don't know of any method to measure that (I even don't know how the number of thoughts thought by the brain can be calculated, I just came across the number by Googling and saved myself from the trouble of figuring out how the number was reached).
