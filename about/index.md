> “Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the dangers of controversy. Speak your mind and fear less the label of 'crack-pot' than the stigma of conformity. And on issues that seem important to you, stand up and be counted at any cost.”


**Hello visitor ! My name is Samyak Choudhary.**

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee and possibly the most unashamedly ambitious person you know. My life ambition is to build a tech or finance company from the ground up, that accomplishes truly amazing things on a global scale (think FORTUNE 500).

This is my personal blog - a miscellaneous collection of thoughts, ideas and events outlining (and shaping) my divergent world view.

Often tagged with labels of freethinker and devil’s advocate, I proclaim myself to be a curious and radical person, overhauling existing existing belief systems and conventional ideas, trying to answer the “WHYs” tormenting my brain and find ways to improve my life and the lives of those around me.

As a voracious knowledge seeker, most of my time is invested in devouring over web articles (on entrepreneurship, tech, business, life hacks, etc), books, online courses, TEDtalks, and Quora. Occasionally I switch over to reading mystery novels, watching thriller movies and TV-Shows as they help keep up the spirit of individualism, inspire confidence (and passion) and are definitely a great entertainment.

Before being smitten by the bug of entrepreneurship, I intended to become a Data Scientist. However, the entrepreneurial drive has least diminished my interest in the field, it has only extended my vision. I aspire to help bridge the gap between what science is capable of and what technology and business offer.

Lately, I have developed a budding interest in Finance, Computational Investing and the Stock Market. I have been exploring these areas through online courses and web articles. I believe a fundamental understanding of finance and economics is essential for everyone for paving the road to personal and societal prosperity, and financial education can mean the difference between a dream achieved or a dream deferred.  

Any entrepreneurial story is incomplete without the concept of social enterprise, and an overwhelming desire to "do good" has taken over me. While exploring the domain of Social Entrepreneurship, I caught the wind of [Enactus](http://enactus.org/). I endeavour to have IIT Roorkee participate in Enactus (first time ever) in 2017 and currently I am working on building a team for the same.

> “You don't learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over.”

As someone deeply inspired by “misfit” entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Richard Branson, I believe pushing boundaries and changing systems is the only way to bring around true innovation and development. 

This blog will be about my narrations along the path to acquire knowledge as I keep on exploring new horizons, questioning prevailing modes of thought and searching for ways to make this a more lively planet .
